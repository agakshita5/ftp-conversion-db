# ðŸ“Š Free â†’ Paid Conversion Funnel 

I created a synthetic dataset simulating user behavior in a freemium app (like Notion, Grammarly, or Canva) â€” focusing on how users move from free plans to paid ones, and where they drop off. Then I built two Tableau dashboards to explore the full conversion journey.

### âŒ— Dashboard 2: Conversion Drivers by Source, Country & Features
Tracks:
- Conversion rate by traffic source (Paid Ads, Referral, Organic)
- Total upgrades by country
- Device usage by country
- Upgrade paths from Free â†’ Paid plans (Sankey chart)

- In 2025, most upgrades came from the US, mainly through organic traffic. Again, 63% of US mobile users upgraded (out of 98)
- Upgrade paths shifted â€” in 2024, most users moved from Free to Enterprise, while in 2025, it was mostly Free to Pro
